      <p>I’m a growing maker of many types always ready to learn, try and fail at something new. I’m passionate about maker education and socially engaged design. Also cats. I love cats. </p>
      <p>As a proud Chicagoan I grew up being resourceful and always making things. I make things rough, cheap and fast, then iterate on that. I thrive in fun interdisciplinary environments.

    <h2>Philosophy</h2> 

    <div class = "col3-block" id = "philosophy">
      <div class = "about-block" id = "about-one">
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>I don’t think most of us do enough of this, myself included. I’m a firm believer that through reflection and shared understanding we could solve a lot of the world's problems and make ourselves better as a whole. From a group spat, product design, user research, creativity and open mindedness reflection fosters long term growth. I think design should facilitate reflection and not just consumption to bring value to people's lives.</p>
      </div>
      <div class = "about-block" id = "about-two">
        <h3>Delight</h3>
        <p>We're all in this together, might as well enjoy it. Most of our functional needs have been met, so the next step is to bring delight into the mundune. Whether a f**k cavaties toothbrush holder or foodprocessor that's run by a stressball, as Marie Kondo would say "Imagine yourself living in a space that only contains things that spark joy" (Kondo fans I'm sorry I've never seen her show. I just googled for quotes). Take functional and make it fun. </p>
      </div>
      <div class = "about-block" id = "about-three">
        <h3>Whatever Works</h3>
        <p>Because I love fast, cheap and janky solutions to problems. There is no perfect solution to anything. Whatever works encourages playfulness, resourcfulness and experimentation to entertain the sillyest solutions that end up being brilliant. If it works it works. It's the spirit of prototyping. It questions perfection and tradition. It doesn't mean you shouldn't find a better solution or settle for less. It's about reflecting on what you really need at the moment.</p>
